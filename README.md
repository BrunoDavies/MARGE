# MARGE Tool

MARGE (unifor**M**ly **A**t **R**andom **G**raph g**E**netation) is a tool that allows you to input a hypergraph domain via a grammar in which you want to generate a uniformly 
at random graph.

Method to accomplish this is based on F. Vastarini and Dr. D Plump's soon to be published paper. Within this they 
alter the uniform at random generation of strings method developed by H. Mairson's [paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/0020-0190(94)90033-7).

The end goal for this tool is to be able to generate *n* number of graphs uniformly at random via two methods: 
1. The first method requires **quadratic time** and **linear space** 
2. The second method runs in **linear time** and **quadratic space**

The core functionally will also include the ability to export these *n* graphs in a useful format.
